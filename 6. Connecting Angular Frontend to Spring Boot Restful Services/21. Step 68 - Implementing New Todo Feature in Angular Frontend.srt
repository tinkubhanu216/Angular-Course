1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,370
There is just one feature which is left in this specific app to really make it a complete app.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,980
That's basically the ad, too.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,540
I mean, there are a lot of stuff out on security that we'll discuss a little later.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,390
And also, we did not really talk about database until now.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,210
So we need to add and stuff a little later.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,120
But from the features perspective on the actual functionality perspective, let's look at adding up

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,460
to do right enough.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,100
So let's add a button here for adding a two and let's call the post method to create a new two.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,450
And let's get that going.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,130
Let's go to Jill's record and let's start with creating a new button.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,180
Let's take the button that we already created.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:52,160
And what I'll do is, oh, here at the bottom of this specific table, I create another div and take

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,230
glass is equal to raw.

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,810
And have my button down there.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,630
And this would actually add to add to.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,160
And and I would want it to be success, right?

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,080
Why do we really want it to be warning?

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,830
Cool.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,450
Let's see the page.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,960
Pretty decent.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,920
Now let's create the add to the method, where do we implemented to lose Dort component?

23
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,720
This is where it would go.

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,240
What we would want to do is add two and two to add it to do, we don't really need to have anything

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,140
right now.

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,060
So what we'll do is we'll just take the user to the to do speech.

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,920
However, for the ad to do what I'll do is I'll pass the ideas minus one.

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,600
So in that application, let's how all the ideas to be positive.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,360
And when the ideas minus one.

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,380
Let's assume that the user is trying to do.

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,030
And to do this, would it help us to use the component that we have already created.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,660
So enough when I click add to the what happens.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,590
Books.

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,660
Apps that make inspect error.

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,090
What error is it.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,770
Compulsion.

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,110
Error.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,140
Let's see what it is all about.

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,080
Cannot read property ideas of undefined.

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,070
What is happening.

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,200
When I click add to do to do that.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,820
Idee.

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,300
Huh?

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,600
That's the problem.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,840
What we did was when we copy pasted it, we forgot to actually remove what to do today.

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,990
But we don't really need to do Heidi.

47
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,540
Right.

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,730
So let's fix that and let's get back to where we were.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,630
Let's add.

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,250
OK, good enough.

51
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm able to go to the next screen.

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,870
The thing is, if you look at the console, you'll see that there is an error.

53
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,680
It says cannot read description often.

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,960
And if you go to the network, go back and add.

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,170
Let's clearly cancel right enough.

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,660
Let's try and add it to do you see that there is a request going into minus one?

57
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,770
So this is not really good because he's actually fighting a request.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Why is it fighting a request?

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,410
Because that's what we told it to do in two court component.

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,660
Dotty's drank a lot to do that component, Dr. Pierce.

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,830
And what does it to do that competent teachers do?

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,780
When you pass in an I.D., it actually tries to quality it.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,930
It seems to what I do is, oh, here we said this third I.D. is equal to we got the idea from the parameters

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,500
and oh, here we created it with the hardcoded one.

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,190
Instead of that.

66
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,860
I think it's a better thing to do desert I.D. in here so that we use the I.D., which is coming in to

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,660
create the to do the other thing which we want to do is we would only want to call this if to do is

68
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,620
if the to do I.D. not dispense equally.

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,650
So if this dot I.D. not equal to minus one only then, then you'd want to call this specific thing.

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,670
So I'll put this in if.

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,250
So that when it's a neutral, you don't really need to call the retreat to do so, used to get the details

72
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,750
of it.

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,630
And the other thing is when we do a save.

74
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,660
We need to exactly do similar condition to if if this third I.D. is equal is equal to minus one.

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,430
Then what do we need to do?

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,620
We not need to actually call update.

77
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,860
We need to color create or else we need to call update.

78
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,730
So let's format this and get this right here.

79
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,840
We need to call create to see if to do that.

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,730
Idee is a political two minus one.

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,350
Then create otherwise update and same thing down here as well.

82
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:37,580
So here we are saying these are ideas equal to we are getting it from the usual parameters, sorted

83
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,960
out parameters and we are creating a default to do to represent it while we are getting it from the

84
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,760
service.

85
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,950
And if the idea is not minus one, then you need to get it.

86
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,140
Otherwise, we agree on you to do so.

87
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,870
We don't really need to get the values from the database.

88
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,940
Let's see if this is all working out fine.

89
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,720
Now to do minus one.

90
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,210
Okay.

91
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,690
I don't see any arrows down here.

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,300
That's cool.

93
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,420
This is the default that I wouldn't want to see.

94
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,220
Two to one.

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,010
Cool.

96
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,450
I'm seeing the details of one.

97
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,950
So both of them are working finally.

98
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,660
Go back to two minus one, because that's what we would want to focus on the new to do.

99
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Now, if I click save, we don't really have anything implemented yet, because if you do that, if

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,640
this variety is visible to minus one need created to do.

101
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,220
But they're not done it yet.

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,070
Creating the create is very similar to the update to do.

103
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,370
Right.

104
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,110
So create two.

105
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,500
And you don't need to pass an I.D. and the UI role would not have the idea as well.

106
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,270
And instead they put it up post.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,550
That's cool.

108
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,660
Now, let's go back to true component and make a call.

109
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,940
So how do we make a call?

110
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,460
This is.

111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,530
Create to do.

112
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,800
I don't need to pass in the I.D..

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
And there is data coming back.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,820
I would just need to log it and I would need to rout it back to the truth.

115
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,510
That's good.

116
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,510
So we don't really need to do anything else.

117
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,820
Let's look at it right now.

118
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,360
Let's wait for the whole thing to refresh.

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:25,890
I guess it has already refreshed and lets in to learn Microsoft uses a gain and save.

120
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,280
Cool.

121
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,610
Let's see if I have learned Microsoft.

122
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,850
Is this again down here.

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,570
Cool.

124
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,120
I see.

125
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,150
Learn Microsoft is is again down here.

126
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,830
That's awesome.

127
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,620
Right now.

128
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,390
She does this.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,500
Let's try and update this so you can see that it was a sign that idea or for.

130
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,370
Let's update it lent again.

131
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,790
Forward save.

132
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,130
Cool.

133
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,930
You can try and test it a little more.

134
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,140
And now we have most of the features that we would want.

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,880
We have the update feature, the lead feature, and we can add a new to do as well.

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,640
Congratulate yourself and I'll see you in the next step.
