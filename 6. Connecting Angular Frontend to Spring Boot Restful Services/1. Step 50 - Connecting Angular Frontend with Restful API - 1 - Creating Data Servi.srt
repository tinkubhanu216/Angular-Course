0
1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,810
We created a few services using spring boot the last few steps.
2

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,790
And when I ran this Hello World application,  I get this message back.
3

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:19,150
Now the interesting part is how do you call these services 
from your front-end, and from our application.
4

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,860
What we'll start with is we take the welcome screen, and we add a button in here so let's add a button
5

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,390
in here. And our eventual aim is to be able to call the service and see the message which is coming back
6

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:41,860
in here. The next few steps would help you understand the complexities associated with invoking RESTful 
7

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,920
API from angular applications.
8

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,290
We will use something called HTTPClientModule, where you'll see that Angular provides us with an awesome
9

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,150
framework based on something called the observable.
10

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,950
But let's get started now.
11

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,820
Let's start with enhancing the welcome screen to have a button, and something which we can click. Before
12

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,800
we get started,
13

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,890
Make sure that you are able to run the REST service, as well as you have your Angular thing up and
14

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,590
running.
15

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,510
Or you go to our favorite IDE. visual studio code, and let's move on to welcome.component.
16

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,800
ts. similar to what we would want to add.
17

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,970
So let's copy this out.
18

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,840
I'll copy this, and create a todo. What I'll do is allow a simple message in here: click here.
19

20
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:39,200
to get customized welcome page. and let's have a simple button in here right... button.
20

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,140
And what do you want to do?
21

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,010
We would want to enable the click event, to click. So we are doing and event binding.
22

23
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,990
So we would want to bind to a specific method, and just call this get welcome message.
23

24
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:01,670
We create this method. let's create this method. I call this:  get welcome.
24

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,190
cool! If you would go to the screen, you would see that it would refresh and you have the get welcome
25

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,790
a message.
26

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,860
Let's add a simple class .button.
27

28
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,130
The bootstrap... and we would want to set this button.
28

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,460
Success.
29

30
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:32,090
It doesn't reflect! It's time for me to relearn my CSS... thinks I should not really have a dot in here.
30

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,350
So the message at the place here.
31

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,740
Now to get welcome message ...button appears in the form we would want.
32

33
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,380
What you want to do is click on this button right.
33

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,560
If I click this button right now what would happen.
34

35
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,270
You know what would happen.
35

36
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,760
It would give us an error.
36

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Obviously right! To go to the console, you would see that there's an error.
37

38
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,680
There is no method of that kind present.
38

39
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,810
So getwelcomemessage() is not a function so we should recreate this function.
39

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,850
Think about it.
40

41
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,660
Where should I create the getwelcomemessage function?
41

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,160
The component is welcome.
42

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,310
Component.ts is where we would go.
43

44
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:15,360
And let's quickly create that function.  getwelcomemessage() is the method that would be
44

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,220
invoked when ... console.log() getwelcomemessage().
45

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,130
Cool.
46

47
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,580
When I say get welcome message
47

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,230
Get welcome message is printed out to the console. let's comment out the other message which is coming
48

49
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,640
in here.
49

50
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,570
The console.log() which you wrote in an earlier step.
50

51
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,630
So the only thing which we see right now is what we get from here.
51

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,240
That's good.
52

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,310
Now we have a button, we have tied it to a method inside the welcome component. But what we really want
53

54
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,030
to do is we would want to invoke this hello world.
54

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,280
That's the thing that we would want to do.
55

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,370
How do we invoke the service?
56

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,690
As usual we create a new service.
57

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:07,370
This service would call up backend service a backend API.
58

59
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:15,390
That's the reason why we call it data service, and getting what you get is the welcome message.
59

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,670
Let's go back to our favorite Angular CLI.
60

61
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,330
Make sure that you are inside the folder.
61

62
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,010
You can see if I open the present working directory in the root folder of the Angular application.
62

63
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,760
That's cool.
63

64
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,540
I want to generate a service. ng generate service... and I want to have a service...
64

65
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,680
So what I do is I create it in folder structures service/data.
65

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,060
So this is where we have all the services.
66

67
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,950
Lets group all the data. So we sit in the data folder and what data does it get ?So the data it would get
67

68
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,460
is welcomeData
68

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,220
So I'm saying service/data/welcomeData
69

70
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,790
So we had to create a data service in the folder.
70

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,510
So with /data to what would have been PRESS ENTER It would create a couple of files as usual.
71

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,020
And it's welcomeData service.
72

73
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,190
Let's take the welcome data service to pick up the welcome data.
73

74
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,270
These file and over here, you can see that it's typical thing which is ready for dependency injection
74

75
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,200
because it has @injectable within the scope so that's cool.
75

76
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,830
We go ahead and create a simple method in here, which would help us in retrieving the data from the backend
76

77
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,520
server.
77

78
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's create a method down here, that we can use to work the Hello World Service.
78

79
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:51,820
I call this execute hello world bean service.
79

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,230
Let's not really do anything.
80

81
00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:01,550
It's just log execute hello world bean service.
81

82
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,660
Now what do you want to do?
82

83
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,160
We want to make use of this service in the welcome component.
83

84
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,940
So let's go with the welcome component.
84

85
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,010
And we would want to use the welcome the welcome data.
85

86
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,940
So we see it here how can we do that.
86

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,430
You need to use dependency injection.
87

88
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,430
Use your let's reformat this so that we can have multiple things clearly listed.
88

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:36,500
So I will say service... what you'd want to do, is use welcome data service. So let's go and import it in.
89

90
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,590
You see that there is a welcome data service which would be put it at the top.
90

91
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,720
service: WelcomeDataService that's cool!
91

92
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,670
What we want to do here, is we would want to call it i the getWelcomeMessage.
92

93
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,660
this.service.execute
93

94
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,730
HelloWorldBeanService
94

95
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
So is that what you would want to do.
95

96
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,510
remove this one because we don't really need it anymore.
96

97
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,700
That's what would happen, if it's going to this application.
97

98
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,030
Click... wait for it to relaunch... get.
98

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,080
So it's executing the Hello World Service.
99

100
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,640
It is not really written
100

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,670
The logic for it yet. What we do in the next step is focus on the logic for the higher level.
101

102
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,110
Let's see how to call the execute hello world bean service,  in the next step.
102

103
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,010
I'll see you in the next step.
