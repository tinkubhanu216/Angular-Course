00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,140
Welcome back. In the previous steps, we implemented the Http client, and when we click get a message we get you
1

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,160
a customized welcome message, hello world changed.
2

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,590
That's cool! We're able to get some text back and show it on the front end, and that's wonderful.
3

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,920
But what if something goes wrong?
4

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,720
What if the server is throwing an exception?
5

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,790
What if there's an error when you're calling a specific service?
6

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,960
How do you handle that?
7

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,500
Let's see what would happen. Right now,
8

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,870
There is an error on the server.
9

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,010
I'll comment this out and I'll take a shortcut: throw new
10

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,900
RuntimeException. That's exceptional.
11

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,520
throw new runtime exception and say OK some error has happened.
12

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,500
create a message.
13

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,340
Right some error happened, contact support at so and so OK.
14

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:56,610
Let's say this was a properly customized error message which is coming up from the server. Let's say this
15

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,790
is the thing which is present right now.
16

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,240
When I say get welcome message now.
17

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,410
What would happen?
18

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,670
It gets an earror response.
19

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,670
Let's load the page again and another click get welcome message.
20

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,720
What would happen?
21

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,520
You'd see that there's an error there.
22

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,820
So it says get 500 error response.
23

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,710
But the user has no signal that some error has happened.
24

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,250
You don't expect error. So go to the console and see the fact that there's an error.
25

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:23,820
Right?
26

27
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,160
So you don't want the user to be doing that.
27

28
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,870
You would want the user to be having a visual representation of what's happening.
28

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,300
You need to tell the user something really going wrong.
29

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,470
How do we do that? well we can do that is by using the Subscribe. Subscribe method the first parameter
30

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,100
is the function to handle successful response.
31

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,620
You can adding another parameter to tell what should happen when there is an error.
32

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:02:00,690
at this point. So I can say handle error response, and over here what I can do is I can pass in error.
33

34
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:11,370
now what i'll do id: this.handle error response it's not really defined in here.
34

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
So let's do that... handle
35

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,510
error response for error.
36

37
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,520
Let's handle that in here.
37

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,090
So what we need to do.
38

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,670
I'll say this error message from server... is I'm taking a shortcut in here.
39

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,920
The ideal way you do that is probably adding error message at the top.
40

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,230
So you would go to the welcome component.  have another div at the top, which would be shown over here, the
41

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,810
error message is active.
42

43
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,190
So you would have a *ngIf the error message you might have an added variable in here saying
43

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,450
error message.
44

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,540
And you can populate that for now.
45

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,730
Let's just take a shortcut.
46

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,700
I'll say this.welcome message from service = error.
47

48
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,570
Let's look at the error object which we printed earlier.
48

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,400
I've not saved this yet, so get would give me an error object.
49

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,270
So this is the response which we get.
50

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,410
If you look at the structure of this, it says error message before doing this, what i'll do is i'll
51

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,450
log it... and console.log()
52

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,270
and console.log() error message, just to confirm that our reading of
53

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,690
The thing is right. Refresh this page.
54

55
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,550
Now I do get a message?
55

56
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,250
So what we are saying is this is the response.
56

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,050
This is the response to error, and this is the message that's cool.
57

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,490
So we are able to get the message here.
58

59
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,790
We just need to fix a little bit of stuff.
59

60
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,060
So all here should be error.
60

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,510
Message. Let's refresh the page.get welcome mesaage
61

62
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,070
Some error has happened.
62

63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,420
Contact support at so and so.
63

64
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,140
So now when there's an error we are issuing this text out.
64

65
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,460
This is the way you can handle it.
65

66
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:14,090
What we're doing in here is we are defining a common error response.So we're saying when there's an error.
66

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,000
Do this. What we did in here is, we create data under the parameter with the subscribe, then defining how
67

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,090
to handle the error.
68

69
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,610
So when there's an error now, what would happen it would call the handle response. Let's comment out
69

70
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,840
the console.log.
70

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,870
We don't need these anymore.
71

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,840
What is important for us is all the stuff which is presented here.  let's comment  out other things which are present
72

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,100
in here as well, so that we don't really have any logs out there.
73

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,860
What we have is when there's an error in here. Ideally we should act on it in a different block at the
74

75
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,430
top, but that I would leave it to you as an exercise. For now we have to use the same thing for the success
75

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
message and the error message as well.
76

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,870
I'll see you in the next step.
77

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,380
Bye!
