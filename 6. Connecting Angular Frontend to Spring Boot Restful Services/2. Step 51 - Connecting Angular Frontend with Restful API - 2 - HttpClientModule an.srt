00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,410
Welcome back. The last step, we created the basic framework. In this step, let's focus on really working the
1

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,130
Hello World Service.
2

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,370
Now how do we work this out? Angular provides a module called HTTPClientModule
3

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,580
And as part of it we have something called HTTPClient
4

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:32,050
We can use the client to get, post, delete, put: all kinds of HTTPP requests. All that we need to say is
5

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,530
OK this is the URL, and this is the data.
6

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,020
Let's use that in this,
7

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,330
And the subsequent steps.
8

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,990
Let's get the HTTPClient in here.
9

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,870
So how do they inject it in? add it to the constructor.
10

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:56,610
Right I'll say private http: HTTPClient.  so you can see that HttpClient is coming
11

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,630
in here. Make sure that it's coming in from an @angular/common/http
12

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,820
There is another HttpClient which is present in here. If you go a little down it's coming from selenium.
13

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,530
web-driver/http. So make sure that you're using the one from the angular/common/http.
14

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,310
If this client is not really listed.
15

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,530
All that you need to do is just put @ in here and make sure that you are putting this important
16

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,390
to import HTTPClient
17

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,430
This is part of a module angular/common/HTTP.
18

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,270
So the client does not automatically appear.
19

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,800
Make sure that you do this, it would be cool.
20

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:45,550
Now we have the http client imported in, and now let's go to work. this.http.get()...
21

22
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,400
one which you would want to do that. We would want in a GET request to what URL? to Hello World.
22

23
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,910
Isn't it easy?
23

24
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,060
Doesn't this look very easy? or it will return this back.
24

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,870
let's remove
25

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,170
this log, we'll not need it anymore.
26

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:11,300
So let's return this thing back. And what we'll do is, in the welcome component let's do a log of this.
27

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,750
So what we did is welcome back from the service.
28

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,800
We are trying to log.
29

30
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,890
Is that what we're doing
30

31
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,420
Let's see what would happen.
31

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,310
OK.
32

33
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,860
When I when I go to the page and refresh it
33

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,870
I see error.
34

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,710
It says No provider for HttpClient
35

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,180
So what it's saying is the client is not really available.
36

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860
Why is it not available?
37

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:45,050
Think about it... think about the concept of an alert for an angler application. To make use of a component
38

39
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,860
or a utility from a module,
39

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,900
What do we need to do?
40

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,990
We need to import that module in.
41

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,190
The thing is we have not really imported the module in the way... we need to put it in in app.module
42

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,810
.ts
43

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,150
And the module that you need to import in, is HttpModule. It's HttpClientModule
44

45
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,370
So you can see that it's from angular/common.http.
45

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,660
So let's do that. imporitng this module into our app module
46

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:23,000
Make sure that you have this import. So the import client module... http client module from angular/common
47

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,960
/HTTP.
48

49
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,270
Now save this and go ahead.
49

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,280
And again when you log in and click to get the message, you would see that there is an observable which
50

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,340
is printed out to the console.  so interesting!
51

52
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,890
Right!
52

53
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,530
What is happening is, an observable is printed to the console.
53

54
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:47,370
And when I go to the network, clear it by using the clear and again to get a message, you're seeign that no activity
54

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,050
is taking place in the network. You can see what other requests which are sent from the client
55

56
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,020
application.
56

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,130
So for applications from the front end application, to the back and application.
57

58
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,470
And as of now, you can see that there is no request going out.
58

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,430
However when I go to the console whenever I press get welcome message, you see that there is an observable
59

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,110
which is getting logged.
60

61
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,130
This call is not going over the network.
61

62
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,140
What is happening in here? Lets look at that in the next step.
62

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,910
Until then, bye!
