00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,400
Welcome back. In the step, let's define a simple view for the todo page.
1

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,250
Where do we go?
2

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,510
It's todo.component.html, and all here what do we need to do.
3

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:20,930
We would want to define our todo component. So I'll start with creating a div class = container
4

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,570
and over here, we would want to define two elements in the two page.
5

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,980
The first thing that we would want to see, is the description of the todo, and the other thing which
6

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,570
you would want to do, is the target date of the todo. We start with the description in a simple word.
7

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,020
I would have said input type = a text, name = a description.
8

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,860
And I would say this is required.
9

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,670
So this is basically all you need to do in a very simple world.
10

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,130
For the description field.
11

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,870
And similarly for the date field in particular, that name is going to target date, and target date.
12

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,420
Also is required to see the page. Right now if you have these two things coming up,
13

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,260
Don't really look very nice, right?
14

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,910
Let's add a h1 at the top too.
15

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,930
Let's start with making these a little bit better.
16

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,430
So I'd say class = form control.
17

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,780
This is one of the classes which is present in Bootstrap.
18

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
It looks a little better right now.
19

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,560
Let's create a fieldset to make sure that we have a label as well.
20

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,730
So we create a field to it, and we'll have a label for this.
21

22
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,720
So we'll have a label, and the label for this specific thing.
22

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,780
Let's have it as description
23

24
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:57,400
let's type in, and let's format the whole thing out, and let's have something similar for the type field.
24

25
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,840
So let's copy the field stuff out.
25

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,870
And this one, the label would be Target
26

27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,510
Let's quickly look at how it looks.
27

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,550
Hopefully much better then earlier.
28

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,300
OK.
29

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,660
So we have a decent looking form.
30

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,400
Now I can select a date in here by clicking this.
31

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,500
If you're using a different browser, there might be a different way of selecting it.
32

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,680
But for now I can enter a description. I can enter a date that's decent enough.
33

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,170
Let's add another class which makes it even better.
34

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,390
class = form group
35

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:41,260
classes which we are all adding in are typical bootstrap classes, just to make you look a little better.
36

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,510
If I wait for the page to refresh.
37

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,790
This looks like a pretty decent form that we can work with.
38

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,050
Now let's add in a button at the top.
39

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,970
Actually not at the top, at the bottom, so that we can actually do the update.
40

41
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:03,700
I'll call this button Save, and let's add a class Button and Btn success because we are going to
41

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,440
save details.
42

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,490
That's fine.
43

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,770
And let's add in method call for this.
44

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,890
So on click of this button what do we do?
45

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Let's invoke a method
46

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,210
Save todo.
47

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,240
Let's see how this looks like.
48

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:31,130
Now we have a pretty good looking page, where we can enter the description, I can edit todo.
49

50
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,310
But what we want to do, is we want to get the details of the existing todo, and throw them in here because
50

51
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,930
we are trying to update.
51

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,790
We are trying to update an existing todo, or we will want to get an update existing todo, and show it
52

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,780
in here.
53

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,330
In the next step.
54

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,910
let's focus on creating a service to retrieve the details of a specific target.
55

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,520
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye!
