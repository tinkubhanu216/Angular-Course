00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:08,840
Welcome back. Until now, we have created the entire structure of the application. We have created
1

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,910
the welcome page.
2

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,030
We learned how to call a http service in the background.
3

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,720
And now let's start focusing on creating the services.
4

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,910
So until now we have just a list of todos which are being shown, but this list of todos is hardcoded.
5

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:30,260
What we focus on here on, is to start getting the list of tools from the backend. We would want to be
6

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,780
able to edit to those. We would want to add a new todo, and we would want to be able to delete a
7

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,990
todo. So we would want to create back-end services for each one of those features.
8

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:46,890
And we would want to be able to invoke them from the front end. The services that we would need.
9

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,420
One I would want to be able to retrieve all the todos for a user.
10

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,990
The second one I would want would be to be able to delete a todo, delete to do of a
11

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:05,420
users. We would want to be able to edit it  the todo, and we would want to be able to create a new todo which
12

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,350
of course may be used to retrieval all todos for a user.
13

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,870
Typically we would use get or retrieve all the todos for the user, and the way we would design the service
14

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:23,340
to have URL users /username. For this user, we would want to retrieve all todos.
15

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,610
So we want to do a GET request to users/username. The username would be a path variable, and we would want 
16

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,410
to get all the tools for that specific user.
17

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,820
Now how do I delete a specific todo? The way I can do that is by using the delete method.
18

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,700
So I use delete request method, and you'd want to pass in which to do you would want to delete.
19

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,720
So todo_id. Now if you want to edit a todo,
20

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,670
How do we do that?
21

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,590
The way we can do that is by using put method. When you want to edit or update, it it is nothing but an
22

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,490
update and we want to update a resource you'll want to use
23

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,390
Put. The remaining stuff would remain exactly the same as the Delete, to put a specific user.
24

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,660
You would want to update a todo, and the last one is to create a new todo.
25

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,580
Which method would we use to create a new todo? We would be using post method,  and which you want
26

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,460
to post to?
27

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,980
You'd want to post to the todos you are in.
28

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,630
So this would be the resources that we would be creating.
29

30
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,470
So we could get resource, or delete resource, or put resource, and post resource.
30

31
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,060
We start with creating this resource to retrieve all the todos for a user, in the next step.
31

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,830
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, Bye!
