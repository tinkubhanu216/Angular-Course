00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,990
Welcome back. In the previous step, we created the delete method for the resource. In this step.
1

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,700
Let's try and execute it.
2

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,710
What we do is we use REST API client called restlet.
3

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,350
So if you search for restlet client, REST API testing,
4

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,940
You should find a good chrome plugin in of this kind.
5

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,610
Go ahead and install this.
6

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,650
I will install it.
7

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,950
Is that what you would see remove from Chrome.
8

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,310
But if you are not installed, then you would be able to see the Install button which you can use. So go
9

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,370
ahead and install it, and once you install it you'd see an icon like this.
10

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,940
If you don't see an icon like this, then you can click this and you should see an icon down here somewhere.
11

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,710
So it's this blue color icon which you've seen here.
12

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,900
And once you click this it would open up the restlet client it would....
13

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,900
The first page.
14

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,190
It's taking a while to load up the first page.
15

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,400
If this is not the first page you are seeing, then you would be able to do a skip.
16

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,140
You don't really need to create an ID to be using this.
17

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,200
So on the previous page, you'd be able to skip it and actually come into this specific thing.
18

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:09,820
What do you want to do, is we want to be able to execute a delete request, and the URL is localhost:8080 user
19

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,410
in28minutes/todos/
20

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,030
The id of the todo that you would want to delete.
21

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:22,460
So this is good, and now I create the send request and you see that I'm getting a 403.
22

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,870
When you look at the statuses,it is 403. forbidden. the  reason why this request failed is because
23

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,850
what the restlet client does is, it sent the origin as this specific.
24

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,060
URL. So since the origin is this.
25

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,870
And if you look at our specific configuration, we only allow requests from this specific origin.
26

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,190
So let's configure our origin.
27

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,970
And so the way we can do that is by saying origin, and we can specify the URl as 4200 and.
28

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,760
If you do send, you you'd see that the response is 204.  204 is no content and that's cool.
29

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,810
That means our request has executed successfully. Now if you go to the todos application, go to the
30

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,880
homepage and come back to the todo page.
31

32
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,630
You would see that our ID todo is deleted.
32

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,890
One of the important things that you need to remember, is each time this application is restarted. That
33

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,560
means every time you make a change in this application it restarted.
34

35
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,690
And every time it's restarted you'd see that the data would refresh. The data from the hardcoded so it
35

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,770
would be refreshed.
36

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,440
So each time what would happen is when I go to the home and todos, you would see the data completely
37

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,870
again. In this quick step, we focused on executing the delete request. In the next step, we enhance our
38

39
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,830
UI to be able to execute the delete request.
39

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,830
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye-bye!
