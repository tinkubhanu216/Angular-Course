00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,420
Welcome back. In the previous steps we implemented the  get welcome message.
1

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,000
And we implemented the error handling for it.
2

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:17,410
Let's go back and let's comment  the Exception out, and let's go back to the default stuff that we are
3

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,620
getting the helloworldbean.  Wait for the server to restart . So if you click get
4

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,480
welcome message, you see that it's getting the proper message back. That's good!
5

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:34,380
So we have the basics of quality http service worked out.  What we do now is we will try and call
6

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,270
the next service.
7

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,110
What we do want to do is, we would want to call this service with the path variable. How do we do that?
8

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,270
It should be a quick exercise to get that done, in this specific step.
9

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,190
So the URL is helloworld/  path variable get that in here quickly.
10

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,190
hello world path variable. it will take in28minutes and then we would get hello world in28minutes as the response.
11

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,220
So this is the URL that we need to call.
12

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,980
So let's pick that up.
13

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,830
We need to first define welcome data service. welcome data.
14

15
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,740
service... this is where we would go< and here I'd want to use this.
15

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,350
You are going to call it so I'll call this: execute Hello world.
16

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,180
Service with path variable.
17

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,910
And you need a parameter
18

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,880
You need to pass a path name.
19

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,810
So this in28minutes is a parameter it's a path variable  actually.
20

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,310
So how do we pass path variable?
21

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,280
So let's pick this up in this specific thing.
22

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
This specific thing is the path variable
23

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,550
It's a variable
24

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,540
But it's not really a constant.
25

26
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,360
How do we take the name, and put it in here? The way you can do that is by using ticks.
26

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,510
So here what we have is a string (single quote), where you can replace it with a tick.
27

28
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,220
Here we are putting the tick character in, and when you do  that, you can use something called dollar open brace
28

29
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,610
and name
29

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,570
So I could have actually done a string append and added name,  but the best practice is to use a tick
30

31
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,620
inside it.
31

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,020
You can put variables.
32

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,640
So these variable values would get automatically replaced.
33

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,950
So this is so that we would want to call. Let's go back to the welcome component.
34

35
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,850
Yes I'll copy this get welcome message, and call it get welcome message.
35

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,770
Well what we wanted to do is we want to call this.execute.
36

37
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,490
hello world service, what is the method that you'd want to call, andcall on the path name as the parameter
37

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
of the name as the parameter
38

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,470
And what do you want to do on successful
39

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,250
response, is exactly the same.
40

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,350
So we'd want to get the message and show it.  What I'll do now,  is I'll go to the welcome.component.html
41

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,310
and instead of calling the get welcome message, let's switch to calling get welcome message with.
42

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:08,830
Parameter. Let's go ahead and call the get welcome message. You would see that get hello world in28minutes
43

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,950
is printed out there. See how easy it is to invoke external services in angular.
44

45
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,000
Once you have everything worked out. Once you have the framework well-designed, you'd be able to
45

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,720
easily call external services with Angulat. In this step, we created a new method in the welcome data service
46

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,150
which allows us to pass a Parameter, and we executed that from the welcome component.
47

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,370
And we saw that we did not really have to do a lot of work.
48

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,580
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye!
