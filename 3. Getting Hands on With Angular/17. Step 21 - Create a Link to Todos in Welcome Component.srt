00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,130
Welcome back. In the previous step, we worked on the todos,  we created todos page,
1

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,940
As of now we don't really have a route from the welcome page to the todos page.
2

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,970
Let's create a simple route between them, using a link.
3

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,370
Let's open up the welcome.component.html, and what we want to do here is we said Welcome welcome to our
4

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,960
awesome App.
5

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,550
And after that what do you want to do, is you can manage your todos here.
6

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:42,230
And I would want to make it here as a link. So over here, we would want to link to the news page.
7

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,040
Welcome to this page, What I'll do is use something called routerLink.
8

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,800
There is one of the routing directives. So let's see what will happen.
9

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,790
So I said routerLink = /todo.
10

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,290
Let's refresh the page and you can see you can manage your todos here.
11

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:07,690
Let's put a br out here, just so that it comes in the next line. Or the other option would have been
12

13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:20,750
to just say a div here, put the welcome text within the div, and create another div to have the link
13

14
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,330
when you wait for the page to refresh.
14

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,370
You would see a welcome page like this, and now I can click here.
15

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,690
And when you go there you see that there is an error.
16

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,950
The reason is because I would have I should have used this slash.
17

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,830
Let's see what would happen let's go back to the welcome page and click here.
18

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,190
Now you see that be able to go to this page, to know what we have is the complete navigation to login
19

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,270
page: in28minutes, dummy.
20

21
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,810
Once you login, you would go to the welcome page, and in the welcome page you can click here to go to
21

22
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,550
the todos page.
22

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,780
So we have the navigation built in between the login page,
23

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,800
the welcome page, and the todos page. In this quick step we added a router link so that we
24

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,380
can navigate from welcome page to the todos page.
25

26
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,730
I'll see you in the next step.
26

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,360
Bye bye.
