00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,190
Welcome back. In the previous step, we created the menu, we created the footer, and we saw that all of
1

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,140
them are working fine.
2

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,040
One of the things you would have observed, is when I'm clicking home the page, is getting refreshed now
3

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,780
when I click log in the back page is getting refreshed.
4

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:30,490
That's because of one thing which we did in the header earlier, what was it? Let's open up the menu component
5

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,580
menu.component.html, for each of these links.
6

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,270
What we did was we had href on them.
7

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,040
What href does is it reloads the entire page.
8

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,680
What we are developing in here, is a single page application.
9

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,870
Right? We don't really want to reload everything all the time. The way we should have done this by saying
10

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,770
routerLink. if you do routerLink, Let's say little more more later.
11

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,710
So I I'm replacing href with routerLink everywhere.
12

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:08,920
And now if the page reloads, when I click /home to login and logout.
13

14
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,430
logout would not work obviously.
14

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,080
We have not really built it yet.
15

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,630
So you see that the page does not get refreshed.
16

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,090
The only thing that gets refreshed is the content within that specific thing.
17

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,550
So that's very important.
18

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,850
The reason why I created a separate video, is I wanted to explicitly point out this error, because
19

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,330
this is very important.
20

21
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,550
We are developing single page application and we don't really want everything to be refreshed.
21

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,210
So whenever you are putting a link out to an internal application thing within the angular application,
22

23
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,350
use the router link, do not use href. If you use head href, then the page gets fresh.
23

24
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,800
And that's not really good.
24

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,540
When you go to an external site like an administrator, you don't really have an option.
25

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,470
You have to use a href.
26

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,600
Because it would anyway reload the entire page but for the internal site links.
27

28
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,560
don't use href, always use that routerLink.
28

29
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,190
That's the tip I wanted to leave you with in this specific video.
29

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
I'll see you in the next one.
30

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,930
Until then, bye!
