00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,820
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:09,990
As of now in the application, when you log in and enter a password to log in, this particular thing it created
2

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,030
in sessions storage. However, the only way we are removing this stuff out is by doing a right-click
3

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,530
remove.
4

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,360
We should actually implement that functionality.
5

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,200
We should implement it as part of our logic.
6

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,620
Let's quickly do that in this specific step.
7

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,070
We'll start off creating the logout component.
8

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,870
Be very careful.
9

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,210
We are not creating a service.
10

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,720
What we are creating is a component.
11

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,310
Actually we are going to create a logout component. So ng generate component logout... go out and do that
12

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,880
and that's cool.
13

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,960
So logout is done.
14

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,450
If you click logout right now will it work.
15

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,390
Nope not yet.
16

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,560
Not so fast.
17

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,550
Why?
18

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,930
Because you've not done the routing right.
19

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,130
So let's add the routing.
20

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,870
As usual, ** should be the last one.
21

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,100
Do not make the mistake of adding something after **.
22

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:14,830
logout: and it should be logout component and refresh.
23

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,190
/ out
24

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Logout works.!
25

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,970
That's cool.
26

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,030
So now logout pages is there
27

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,750
Now logout.component.html
28

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:32,620
We'll put a h1, You Are Logged Out.
29

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,540
And put a div,  class =container
30

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,700
and just put a simple message out saying thank you.
31

32
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,710
For using
32

33
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,370
our application. cool, you are logged out.
33

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,300
Thank you for using our application.
34

35
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,190
That's good, but is it all? What we want to do is actually go out to the logout.component.ts, and make
35

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,760
sure that the user is logged out.
36

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,300
Now let's go to the hardcoded authentication service.
37

38
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:17,280
We don't really have anything to log out our user, right? So what we do is create a new method
38

39
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,680
logout()
39

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,230
and all that we need to do is say sessionStorage.removeItem()
40

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,220
authenticatedUser.
41

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,750
So what we are doing here, is we are removing the authenticated user from session storage and this particular
42

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,030
thing hardcoded authentication service.
43

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,660
You need to use it in the logout component.
44

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,050
How can we use that?
45

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,850
We need to inject it in a the component.
46

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,850
I'll make it hard coded authentication so use it.
47

48
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,600
Import this in, as we put it in ngOnInit().
48

49
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,680
What do we need to do, when the component is initialized?
49

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,160
To say this.hardcodedAuthenticationService.logout() . what would happen?
50

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,900
The logout method would be called, and we would be logged out.
51

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,660
Let's see what would happen if it we refresh.
52

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,970
You'd see that you are logged out, and that's removed in sessionStorage..
53

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,830
If the value is there, you can see that the value is not there.
54

55
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,320
This is basically the search thing, and you can see that it's not there.
55

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,390
Do it again.
56

57
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:44,870
So give dummy log in, and you can see ... let's refresh it...  you can see that in28minutes with its values there.
57

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,990
And as soon as I click logout, you can also see the menus react.
58

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,840
So the menus don't appear. So we'll leave the log in menus here right now and you can see when you refresh
59

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,990
it.
60

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,490
It's also not showing the value in the session storage.
61

62
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,590
Isn't this fun!
62

63
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:09,490
So now we have a proper implementation of a logout and login. So you can see you are logged out... When
63

64
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,100
you log in, and save dummy as the password and log in,
64

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,940
You can go there play with it, and log out.
65

66
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,150
This is awesome right!
66

67
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,880
So this is much more clear application. You have login and  logout features, and all that working perfectly.
67

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,670
The only thing which I don't really like about what's happening in here, is the fact that if I type in
68

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:43,720
localhost:4200/todos, I'm still able to do the see the todos, even though I'm not logged in, and that's
69

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
not really good right!
70

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,890
I would want to be able to see that todo only when I'm logged in.
71

72
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,130
Let's get to that in the next step.
72

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,510
Bye Bye!
