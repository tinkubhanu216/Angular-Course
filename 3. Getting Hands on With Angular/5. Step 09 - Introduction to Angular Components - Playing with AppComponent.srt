00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:09,120
In the previous video, we looked at the basics of component. In this video, let's play around with the app component
1

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,640
a little bit more.
2

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,700
I'll start with going to the app.component.ts, and over here what I'll do is I would want to directly
3

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,430
include the entire template in here, instead of actually putting the UI to where the HTML present.
4

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:33,990
You can also include the exact template. Later I would want to show that one,. For now,  let's start with
5

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,890
just putting the title in.
6

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,350
(I'm using CAPS LOCK!!).
7

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,600
Let's do that.
8

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,540
Let's make this one.
9

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
And this should be <h1>
10

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,250
What would happen?
11

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,570
If I go and refresh the page, it says this module cannot be found.
12

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,720
What it's saying is I'm not able to locate the template you are in.
13

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,210
The thing is I need to change the attribute to template.
14

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,590
So if you say its template then you can directly define the template in here.
15

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,790
So you can see that now, todo is display to the page because that's the only thing which is present
16

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,720
in the template.
17

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,620
What I'll do is undo the change.
18

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,870
Let's go back to where we were earlier.
19

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,620
Comment this out and paste this in.
20

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,040
So what we're doing is we are replacing the template URL. Instead of the templateURL< you'rw
21

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,840
using template and thereby we can actually put the complete code of the component right here, if you'd
22

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,470
want.
23

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,960
You can do something like that with the style as well.
24

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,380
What we'll do, is we'll comment this out and let's continue using that template because we would want to
25

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,970
see a lot of code.
26

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,520
Now if you go to the template, you are able to... what we'll do in here is create additional div. Let's create a
27

28
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:08,390
div Component Content,  and what we'll do with index.html...
28

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,320
Let's go here,
29

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:19,040
And also we're here let's create a div So this div is actually index.html content
30

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
to be created.
31

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,850
There's one in the index.html,  one in the app.component.ts.
32

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,560
If you look at the screen right now, you'd see the content in here.
33

34
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,420
So the content is displayed as part of the index.html.
34

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,870
Now let's style the divs
35

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,450
So I say give background-color just make it
36

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,880
beige.
37

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,750
You can see that just the component alone get the background color, because the content in the index.html
38

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,360
does not get the style.
39

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,140
So what do you put in here,
40

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,430
does not apply to all the div's which are present in here.
41

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,120
What you put in app.component.
42

43
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,670
always only applies to the continent.
43

44
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,400
The scope of the style that you are specifying in here is restricted to the component and that's awesome.
44

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
Let's comment it out
45

46
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,710
The appearance does not really look good.
46

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,000
So let's comment this out. The way I'm doing it is Control-/ or command-/.
47

48
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,330
If you do that it gets commented out. Now,  you would be back to the usual stuff. In this quick video,
48

49
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:38,510
We tried to play around with the component. We tried to create a template directly in here, by using the
49

50
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,640
template properties.
50

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,830
And we tried to create a simple style inside the app.component.ts, and we were able to see that the
51

52
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,870
style was affecting only the specific component.
52

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,060
I would recommend you to try and play around with the template and the templateUrl, and try
53

54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,810
and understand it more as an exercise.
54

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,380
I'll see you in the next step.
