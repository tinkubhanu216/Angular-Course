00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,600
Welcome back. In the previous step, we implemented the logic to do the routing between the login page
1

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,960
and the welcome page. In this step, what we want to do is we would want to take the username which is present
2

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,460
in here, and show it as part of the welcome message.
3

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,110
One of the ways we can do that, is by adding it as a parameter.
4

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:31,060
So the route can accept a parameter. Just I can say welcome in28minutes, what I want to do, is I would
5

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,640
want to take in28minutes parameter, and show here saying OK, welcome to this application.
6

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,780
in28minutes, because that's the name which is being passed in.
7

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,690
How do we do that?
8

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,140
Let's look at it, in this specific step.
9

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:53,890
Let's open up the routing.module.ts, and what we want to say here is you would expect a parameter name. What would
10

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,470
happen from now on, is welcome.
11

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,190
/name would be expected, and that would be routed to the welcome component. now, you need to enhance the  welcome
12

13
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,400
component to accept that about parameter.
13

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,190
How can we do that? Typically in Angular, you would want to inject whatever dependency I would need
14

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,440
To be able to do that.
15

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,490
The dependency that we would need to be able to do that, is called ActivatedRoute
16

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,490
What is the route that is currently active?
17

18
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,870
I need to get that.
18

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,050
And from there, I would be able to pick up the parameter which is passed in. How can I do that?
19

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,750
The way I can do that is by saying private route:ActivatedRoute
20

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,620
So we are making it as one of the arguments to the constructor, so that they should be injected in by
21

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,200
the Angular Dependency Injection framework.
22

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,480
There's a compilation error on the ActivatedRoute. Control-space and make sure that you're choosing the
23

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,260
right one.
24

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,800
Make sure that you're choosing the Angular router ActivatedRoute, and click the import of ActivatedRoute
25

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,220
in here so import ActivatedRoute from @angular/route
26

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,070
That's good.
27

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,270
Now from this I would want to pick up the route parameter name.
28

29
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:13,650
How can I do that? The way I can do that is by doing this.route.snapshot
29

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,550
So it gives you a snapshot of what the parameter is, which are passed in, and from there I would want
30

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,730
to get the list of items from which I would want to pick up the name parameter.
31

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,030
So let's see if we are able to get this.
32

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,190
Let's do a console.log on this.
33

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,220
If you go to the browser and type in localhost/welcome this would give you an error because now
34

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:46,000
a welcome is no longer defined. What we have defined is welcomed/name so I need a person name
35

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,180
parameter.
36

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,110
welcome/in28minutes. So what is happening now, is some welcome message is just printed and in28minutes
37

38
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,260
if te user name was something else, in Angular would it that guys printed.
38

39
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,650
If I go back to the welcome page and try logging in in28minutes, and dummy, this would give me an error.
39

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,330
It says contact support, because we are redirecting to the welcome page.
40

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,090
We are not putting in the parameter name.
41

42
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,630
How can we fix that?
42

43
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,340
Think about it. Just go to the login component and think about how we can fix that.
43

44
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,370
To app.component.html
44

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,770
How can we fix that?
45

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,270
Actually that should have been too login.component.ts
46

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,270
Does what I can do is I can pass in a  parameter
47

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,080
So after welcome, I can take this.username.
48

49
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,360
So if you are passing the username as a parameter.
49

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
Let's see what would happen.
50

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,540
Go back to login page.
51

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,640
in28minutes, dummy, login.
52

53
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,090
Cool.
53

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,350
Welcome works!
54

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,180
Now what you wanted to do is, we would want to actually use this in the welcome message. So welcome.component.
55

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,630
html. and over here instead of welcome works, 
56

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
I would say welcome to our awesome App.
57

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:18,220
Welcome, and say over here... how can we get the value which is present and the welcome component down here
58

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,560
so we have the name, but how do we show it in here?
59

60
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:30,820
What I'll do is I'll create a member variable, so I'll say name = '',  and over here what we do in the
60

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,550
ngOnInit()
61

62
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:46,110
let's comment this out, and let's take this and say I need to the name. name =  this....
62

63
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,790
is this good.
63

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:54,900
No this is not yet good, because we need to say this doesn't mean that we have the name as part of the
64

65
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,170
component as a component property.
65

66
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:06,960
Now I would want to take it and bind it over here. So what would happen is a welcome in28minutes.
66

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,370
Welcome to our awesome App
67

68
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,030
login again..
68

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,660
It works.
69

70
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,120
In this video,
70

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,340
We looked at how to have a routing parameter
71

72
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,840
So we added a name routing parameter to the welcome route. All that we needed to do was change the
72

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,250
path to add a :name, indicating what the name of the parameter, that would be passed in for that be
73

74
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,330
and hence the component to inject in the activated route, and pick up the parameter from the route parameter.
74

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,140
Next,
75

76
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,070
we made it a member variable, and we enhance the view.
76

77
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,830
welcome view to use that and showed it.
77

78
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,080
The other thing we had to do was enhance the login component to pass in the parameter which was entered
78

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,470
in by the user.
79

80
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,240
The user name which was entered in, was passed as a parameter to navigate(). We have been making
80

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,130
a lot of progress.
81

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,270
And I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye-bye!
