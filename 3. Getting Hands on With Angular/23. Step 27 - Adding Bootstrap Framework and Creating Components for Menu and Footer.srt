00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,460
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,840
One of the things which we would want to do starting now, is make use of a framework called Bootstrap.
2

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,420
bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks.
3

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,140
It helps us to design our pages in a very attractive way, as you can read in here.
4

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,560
Bootstrap is world's most popular framework for building responsive sites.
5

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,890
What we do is really use bootstrap from a content delivery network.
6

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,500
So we just need to search for and package bootstrap for packages.
7

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,180
One of the content delivery networks from which we can pick up this is this file as it is.
8

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,850
So what I'll do is pick up the 4.1.0. Any version which is greater than 4.1.0 should
9

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,980
be fine.
10

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm going to take the CSS,  and I'm going to use the min.css file,  which is present...
11

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,910
bootstrap.min.css.
12

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,510
You can see that this size is much smaller than the bootstrap.css, because it's a minified version.
13

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,530
So let's take this and we'll use this in our application.
14

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,190
We would want to use bootstrap across the application.
15

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,780
So what I'll do is I'll put it in the styles.css, the styles.css  this is at the root of
16

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,700
the project inside the source tree.
17

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,720
So inside the source, you have style.css at the root and  the styles inside
18

19
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,600
this is applicable to the entire angular application. If you need to import this in, is by saying at
19

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:32,340
@import... this is basically CSS syntax... and you can specify the url, is what we see in here.
20

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,160
Yes.
21

22
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,530
I've not saved it yet.
22

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,140
Let's save the page. Before saving it,
23

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,770
It looks something of this kind.
24

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,490
And let's save it and let's see the page after that.
25

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,520
You can see that the font have become a little bigger.
26

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,940
There is much more space.
27

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:55,160
And also you would see that the look off of the pages also would improve a little bit, not a lot.
28

29
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,360
A little bit.
29

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,330
Now what I want to do is also add a menu and a footer as well.
30

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,220
Let's create a couple of components for the menu and the footer.
31

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,110
We use the second command prompt that we already have.
32

33
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,850
What do you want to do, is in general make sure that you are inside the todo folder.
33

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:23,630
So ng generate component type menu, will put menu at the top... so it will create the menu component.
34

35
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,110
That's done... enough!
35

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,480
I would want to also create the footer component.
36

37
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,210
Now what I want to do is at the top of every page, we would want the menu and the footer.
37

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,600
How can we do that?
38

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,880
What I can do is, I can go to the root component... component. What is it app.component.html.
39

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:49,960
If you look at the menu component, your component.html says menu works! . I'll just replace this buy
40

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,150
Top Menu Element , and for now let's just put a BR.
41

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,240
BR.
42

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:06,100
Not the best thing to do, but we'll replace this very soon and we will have footer.component.html.
43

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:16,320
And what we'll do over here, is also FOOTER,  and before the footer,  we'll put a couple of BR's. what we want to
44

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,440
do with include this component in menu.
45

46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,550
And footer.  Think where would we add them in?
46

47
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,430
I would recommend you to pause the video in here and try and do it as an exercise.
47

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,850
We to add it in the app.component, which is where we would want to define our header and footer.
48

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,350
How would we do that?
49

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,180
Pause the video here, and think about it
50

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
I would want to add the menu component here.
51

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,730
And the footer component below it.
52

53
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,090
How do we do that?
53

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,570
OK let's look at the menu.component here.
54

55
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,560
What's the tag name?
55

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,960
It could be app-menu.
56

57
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:59,720
So what we need to do is go to the app.component.html, and replace this this stuff with an app
57

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:13,550
-menu. and What so you do with the footer? Loot at footer.component.ts... app-footer. right? Let's see how the page
58

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,690
looks right now.
59

60
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,070
So you have the top menu element, this thing, and the footer.
60

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:25,190
What we have now, is the basic elements of any that page: like you have a top menu or component, you
61

62
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,820
have a footer component, and you have the actual content, and if you go to the page we can go and login
62

63
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,450
you would see that the top in your element and footer remain as it is. Now I enter login values
63

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,700
the middle of the... content of the of the page changes.
64

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:51,060
Now I click here, and then you would see that the content on the page changes again. In the next few
65

66
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,730
steps, we'll add elements to them, and you will add things to the footer and will make the content of the page
66

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,050
much  more formatted.
67

68
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,940
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye!
