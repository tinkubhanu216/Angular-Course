00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,670
Welcome back. In the previous step, we stored the  user on  authentication into session storage, and we created
1

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:14,700
a method to check for users logged in or not. What we have also done is we made a couple of logs.
2

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,810
It's not really good, so let's comment these out, so that the logs don't disturb us.
3

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,600
We make sure that everything is working fine, so the logs are not really needed anymore.
4

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,250
Now what do you want to do?
5

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,860
You would want to enable and disable menu items.
6

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,030
Based on is user logged in or not.
7

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,060
So I want to enable these links based on user logging in.
8

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,400
How can I do that?
9

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,700
Think about it. If user has logged in, I would want to show different links if a user is not logged in,
10

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,220
I would want to show different things to be done here.
11

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,700
And think about it, before you would proceed to look at the solution.
12

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:59,790
What we have in here is the menu component. menu component defined so  menu.component.html.
13

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,760
HTML
14

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,120
So before we show these links, I would need to check if user logged in or not.
15

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,010
How can I do that?
16

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,960
Think about it.
17

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,410
It should be easy right?
18

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,700
So let's go to another component.
19

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,400
And first add in our authentication service. We need to check whether somebody is logged in are not.
20

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,380
We need the authentication service right?
21

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,500
So let's inject it in and say private authentication hardcoded authentication service.
22

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,640
Actually I'll copy this again and paste it here, and take :. with them.
23

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,050
Let's make it small h.
24

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,310
So we have the hardcodedAuthenticationService very long!
25

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,380
Now what we want to do is on the initialization of this component, will want to check hardcoded authentication
26

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,290
service. For this, you need to say this.hardcodedAuthenticationService
27

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,420
What we would want to find out, what you want to find out.
28

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,790
is the user logged in?
29

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,830
We need to find out if this user has logged in, and let's put this into a variable isUserLoggedIn.
30

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,990
And this would be a boolean, and let's initialize it to false.
31

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,310
And if user is logged in then I would initialize.
32

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,340
What's the error? this.
33

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,460
this.isUserLoggedIn = ...
34

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,780
So now I can do this component property in the view.
35

36
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,690
So let's go to the menu.component.html, and over here I can say display this, only og user has
36

37
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,550
logged in. How can I say that?
37

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,270
Think about it, how can I say that?
38

39
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,790
use ngIf..
39

40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:53,790
If it's equal to ...... so show this only if user is logged in. is logged in ... show this if show only if you
40

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,210
just logged in ... log out.
41

42
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,360
Show it if user is logged in and log in.
42

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,840
show it if user has not logged in.
43

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,260
Right.
44

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,500
I'm putting a not in here.
45

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,560
Isn't that interesting.
46

47
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:16,240
Let's see what would happen. if we refresh page if you see it now three links are shown: home, todos 
47

48
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,890
and log out.
48

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,590
That's cool right!
49

50
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,790
We are able to see all these three links.
50

51
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,580
Let's remove this.
51

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,540
Let's clear this out and let's go back to the homepage. you would see that these three links remain here.
52

53
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,490
So even though it's not they're in session storage, it's still visible. what's happening?
53

54
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,100
Why are we able to see the links, even though I have deleted this from station storage?
54

55
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,070
The reason is because this menu component is initialized only once.
55

56
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,880
Right at the end of the page.
56

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:00,220
So once we leave the page we're not refreshing the content of this menu component, so ngOnInit()
57

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,230
will not be called.
58

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,450
So whatever value was initially stored that remained as it is.
59

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,640
So if I completely refresh the page, so I'm not just clicking the link but I'm refreshing the page you'd
60

61
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,620
see that the links would go away.
61

62
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,250
So you would see that login is the only one which is shown because, in session storage the user name
62

63
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,850
is not there.
63

64
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,780
So you login.
64

65
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,460
Sure.
65

66
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:32,020
And even if now in28minutes, dummy and I login, I would see that only login menu item is shown. Remeaning
66

67
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,560
are not shown because even though the item is there in the session.
67

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,410
So if you refresh the session storage, you'd see that the item is there, but it's not picked up by the menu
68

69
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,770
because the menu is not being refreshed at all.
69

70
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,190
The ngOnInit() on the menu component gets called only when the page gets refreshed.
70

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,770
And the way we can avoid this is by calling the service. So we can go into the menu and the stuff thing
71

72
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,230
we would say this
72

73
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,230
now let's see what would happen if
73

74
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,340
menu gets refreshed.
74

75
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,120
And you would see that you see the links, and when you delete this clear and when you go back to the
75

76
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,880
page immediately, you only see the login page because it's thinking that there is nothing in the section.
76

77
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,300
So the user has logged out.
77

78
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,610
One of the things you would have observed upto now, is even though it is logged out, we are still showing it on the 
78

79
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,250
page.
79

80
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,000
We are still showing the welcome page and things like that.
80

81
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,280
That's something which we would fix very soon.
81

82
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,270
But the important thing for us is to make sure, that the menu items are displayed according to whether
82

83
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,410
the user is logged in or not.
83

84
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,300
And that's what we were able to accomplish in this specific step.
84

85
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:58,110
One of the things I will do, is I'll quickly comment out the stuff which we did in here, which is not
85

86
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,250
being used at all.
86

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,200
This specific thing in here is not being used.
87

88
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,230
These two things are not, so I'll just comment it out.
88

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,190
So it's there for your future reference. In this step, we enabled the menu items.
89

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,130
We enable the top menu items based on what our users log in or not.
90

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,140
One of the important things we keep doing throughout this course, is if we make mistakes that's the only
91

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,660
way we can improvise things.
92

93
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,290
Once you make a mistake and learn from it, you'll never do it again.
93

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,230
And that's the best way to learn.
94

95
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,940
And that's exactly what we keep doing.
95

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,950
I'll see you in the next step . Bye!
