00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,850
Welcome back.  until now,  I've created a number of components: component... login component and welcome component
1

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:15,990
list-todos component, and we saw that whenever we created a component using ng generate component.
2

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,630
Each time the component was getting added into an NgModule, which was app module
3

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:30,410
This app module has an additional NgModule on it, which stands for Angular Module. Anything attached
4

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,320
to the ng is Angular, so Angular Module.
5

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,970
So let's discuss what is NgModule doing, and how were Angular modules are different from javascript modules.
6

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:50,460
When you think about Angular applications, they are built using a number of angular modules
7

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,040
Some of the angular modules are built into angular framework, so you can see FormsModule, AppRoutingModule
8

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,860
BrowserModule, NgModule.
9

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,880
All of these are built in angular modules, inside the angular framework.
10

11
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,770
Whenever we need to use any of the angular features, we needed to import that specific module in.
11

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:25,240
If you remember in the login.component.html, we want to use the module data, to and then be added
12

13
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,120
in the module, that gave us an error.
13

14
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,580
And what did we do at that particular point in time?
14

15
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,920
We imported the FormsModule.
15

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,870
So if you want to use any of the building features in angular, we need to import the corresponding angular
16

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,020
module for it.
17

18
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,490
That's what we observed until now. In summary, all the components that we created until now, are
18

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,920
associated with this Angular module called app module. and whenever we needed to use some other feature from
19

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,390
Angular, we needed to import the specific module.
20

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,310
Thing is, when we think about Angular's applications, you should always think about them as a group of
21

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,390
angular modules. Each component,
22

23
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:20,580
Each directive that you create as part of the angular application are always associated with angular.
23

24
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:29,300
Module. If you look at the syntax of the angular module, it starts with an '@' , @NgModule decorator
24

25
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,660
what the declaration is saying is these five things are part of this specific Angular module.
25

26
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,910
So if some other application wants to reuse the error component, or it wants to use the logging component
26

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,870
What do they need to do?
27

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,620
They would need to make use of this NgModule, so they would need to import the module in and only
28

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,680
then they will be able to make use of the specific component.
29

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,190
The second attribute what you're seeing here is import. import is nothing but the components and directives
30

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,830
of this specific model.
31

32
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,580
What you are saying is component in the app model will need all these modules to work.
32

33
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,590
So we said we need the app.module, we need the browserModule we need the module.
33

34
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,410
We talk about providers a little later when we talk more about dependency injection.
34

35
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,090
The last one that just isn't in here is something called Bootstrap.
35

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,480
Then this module is loaded, which component should be loaded as well.
36

37
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,110
Those are called the bootstrap component.
37

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,900
We have Appcomponent listed in as a bootstrap component in here.
38

39
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,930
So what we have discussed until now is the fact that the module is a group of components are that active
39

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,980
which are dedicated for a specific purpose, and that module is the fundamental block of use in an
40

41
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,560
angular application.
41

42
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,740
If you go through the components, you would need to import the corresponding angular module you.
42

43
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,940
One of the question is, how was the more different from a javascript module? The first important thing
43

44
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:10,890
is you has the annotation in angular, and it is used to group angular component, angular building blocks.
44

45
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,670
A javascript module is a file.
45

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,620
So just any of this module that these files can open into these files, or be created a lot of component
46

47
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,570
of these files until now.
47

48
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,980
So all this component.ts files login.ts, error.ts, welcome.component.ts
48

49
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,590
Each of these each file is a module. You can create any number of classes in the module. You can create
49

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,450
any number of functions in that specific module.
50

51
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:46,140
So each of these things that you are looking at is a Javascript module. In comparison an angular module
51

52
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,950
is something which has @NgModule... annotation on it. Javascript module is used to group different
52

53
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:00,360
elements which are present in a single file, whereas an angular module is used to group different angular
53

54
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:08,820
Components, or different angular building blocks. This angular component might be actually defined in a
54

55
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,020
separate file as well.
55

56
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:19,140
In this video, we quickly looked at the concept of an angular module and compared it with javascript model
56

57
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,780
An Angular module is a grouping of a number of angular building blocks like components.
57

58
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,060
I'll see you in the next step.
58

59
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,500
Until then,
59

60
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,120
Bye bye.
