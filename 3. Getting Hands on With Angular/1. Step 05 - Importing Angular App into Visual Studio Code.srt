00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome back. In the previous step we created an Angular application using Angular CLI.
1

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,560
And we have launched it up, and we saw a plain UI coming up. In the step, what we'll do is we'll import
2

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,210
the project into our favorite IDE, which is a visual studio code. Let's get started now.
3

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm sure you would have the visual studio code installed.
4

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,870
We had it as part of our installation section when you launch up your code.
5

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:35,290
This is the screen you would see. This is the welcome screen and you would be able to see a few help
6

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,830
documentation. You can see the recent projects I had worked on a lot, to make sure that this course is perfect and
7

8
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,770
you can see other stuff about how you can customize and learn about the visual studio code. If you
8

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,350
have some time,
9

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,550
I would recommend you to spend some time exploring the IDE.
10

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,540
One of the things that I have done is I'm using a specific visual studio theme. So if you go to code ->
11

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,380
preferences... if you're on Windows it's file preferences.
12

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,090
You can change the color theme.
13

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,330
What I've done is I'm using a light Visual Studio Theme. I like very light so that it appears clear on
14

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,850
the video, and you can also see this very well on your mobiles.
15

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,420
But if you like dark then you can leave it...the default does this.
16

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,620
Now let's get to the first task of this step, which is to import the project in.
17

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,000
The thing is, in code, importing a project is very easy.
18

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,260
Either you can say open for later, or an even more lazy way of doing it.
19

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,530
Just go to the folder where 
20

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,920
we have the project, in todo the project ,and just drag and drop it in.
21

22
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,160
And that's that the project would launch up. When the project launches up, you would see the Explorer
22

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,420
view.
23

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,200
So this view which we are seeing in here, is the Explorer view. You can toggle it, and toggle it down by  clicking
24

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,820
this icon which just is in here.
25

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,110
Let's open up the files which is present in here: README.md. README.md contain certain
26

27
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,100
amount of documentation about the project that we have created.
27

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,450
So it says it was generated using AngularCLI.
28

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,010
version 7.0.3.
29

30
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,160
It says you can do ng serve.
30

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,570
That's what we're doing right now.
31

32
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,240
And you can use this, you are ready to launch it.
32

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,410
And that's what we did.
33

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,850
Well yes, well there's lot of documentation in here.
34

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,470
You might want to check that out if you want to see this in full screen.
35

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,130
So README is now taking part of the screen, and the Explorer is taking some of the part of the screen.
36

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,060
So you can tell by clicking this, or the other option is to use control-B, or command-B.
37

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,970
So control-B /  command-B.
38

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,860
So if you're on Mac it's command-B, if you are on Windows or Linux it's going to be control-B. So use that and you
39

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
you'd be able to see the entire thing in full screen.
40

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,210
So this is something that would be using frequently.
41

42
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,940
So I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of that.
42

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,540
We'll explain more about your code as we go forward in this course.
43

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,940
I'll see you in the next step.
