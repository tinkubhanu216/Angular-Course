00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,710
Welcome back. In this step, let's start focusing on the footer. Let's go down to the footer component, and let's
1

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,000
start with creating a footer.
2

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,480
So let's create a footer inside it, to create a div, and let's create a container div
3

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,050
inside it.
4

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,300
Let's put All Rights Reserved
5

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:32,910
At whatever thing that you would want to put it in here, and you can maybe put here.
6

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,890
This is how the page looks like right now.
7

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,510
We have a footer at the bottom.
8

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,820
What I would want this, to be here.
9

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,260
So I would want a fixed position for this footer.
10

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,870
What we do is we add a little bit of CSS for that.
11

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,920
What we'll do is we'll open up the footer components CSS.
12

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,390
So this is specific to just the footer.
13

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,950
So we are adding it directly in the footer component, and what we want to do, is what we want to do?
14

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,660
We want to have absolute position.
15

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:10,730
Actually it's position absolute. What we want as it should be at the bottom of the page. Let's give it
16

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:10,860
a width, 
17

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,260
and a height.
18

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,320
It should be 40 pixels.
19

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,580
It's.
20

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:33,500
And let's give it a darker background color #222222.  OK.  and let's see what would happen.
21

22
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,900
Oops!
22

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,870
We did not add the class.
23

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,050
That's the reason why it's not really formatted. .class =  footer.
24

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,000
OK.
25

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,710
Nice.
26

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,860
Now you can see the footer at the bottom,  but I'm not able to see the text.
27

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,560
All right.
28

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,360
I'll go to the footer component, and expand on this.
29

30
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,940
span
30

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,700
would say class=text-white.
31

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,320
Now you can see the footer down here.
32

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,340
I think it's a little too bright, so let's not really use text-white.
33

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,120
Let's make it a little muted.
34

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,240
Now you have this down here.
35

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,610
That's nice.
36

37
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,420
You have a header that's cool.
37

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,560
Let's now focus on the actual content of the page.
38

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,830
Let's go to the root component app.component.html, and over here, what I'll do is I'll include
39

40
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,150
the actual content of the page in div.
40

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,370
Typically if you put something in a container, then it would be appearing with a little bit of padding
41

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,150
and stuff.
42

43
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,140
So are like putting stuff in a container, so it can put the main content of the page inside a container
43

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:03,780
div, and what we'll do is we'll go to the todos.component, and we'll add a class onto this.
44

45
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,860
So we'll remove the border=1.
45

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:17,840
And let's say class=todos, and what we do is we'll have h1, and  then type in.
46

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,600
So this would be to My Todos.
47

48
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,690
And with the caption... we don't really need the caption any more.
48

49
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,290
And next what I'll do is I'll put a little bit of div again.
49

50
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,090
The class=container, so I'll put the table as well.
50

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,870
Another div.Let's do that.
51

52
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,400
And save it.
52

53
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,290
And now this looks much better right.
53

54
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,050
The class I should have added in here should be table. It's now
54

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,430
good enough. the todos page looks much better than what it was earlier.
55

56
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,060
Let's do this stuff on the login page, so that quickly as well.
56

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,460
So what we want to do is we want to add a h1 saying This is Login.
57

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,450
And I'll put it here.
58

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,320
The class is equal to container
59

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,350
and let's repeat this over here.
60

61
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,470
A few things more, What i'll do is use something called the
61

62
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,410
bootstrap has this concept called alert.
62

63
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,950
So we'll use those.
63

64
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,600
That class is called alert, and this would be a warning alert, which is an error message.
64

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,880
Try doing that and over here, all the other stuff.
65

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,410
Kind of looks good.
66

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,770
That's good.
67

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,720
Put the login page and see how it looks.
68

69
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,970
Cool! login page.
69

70
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,480
The only thing which I don't really like is the login button.
70

71
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,590
Let's add a class onto this button as well.
71

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,340
So that's at a class=btn and btn-success.
72

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Now we have a login.
73

74
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,340
Now the login page looks relatively well-designed, good enough and you can see you can go in here.
74

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,940
Let's call the welcome page, and design it a little bit. What i'll do is is remove this chunk between this. Let's have just
75

76
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,130
one line
76

77
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,100
welcome, and that should be fine.
77

78
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,720
And let's add a class=container, and let's add an h1.
78

79
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,100
OK! welcome! It says welcome in28minutes
79

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,890
it goes here and management todos, the home link works,  todos link works.
80

81
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,560
login link works. in28minutes.
81

82
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,910
Dummy will be able to log in.
82

83
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,930
Now you'll see that most of the stuff on this page looks much better than what it was earlier in the
83

84
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,830
last two steps.
84

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,880
We used a little bit of CSS, little bit of bootstrap to make these pages look better.
85

86
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Bootstrap is definitely not the focus of this course, but even then if you search for bootstrap, for you'd
86

87
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,960
be able to get to this website, where you have a lot of information about bootstrap, and a lot of examples
87

88
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,540
as well.
88

89
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,180
I recommend you to spend some time with all this stuff and all,  some time later.
89

90
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,170
For now let's focus on Angular. And I'll see you in the next step.
