00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Welcome back. In this course, we initially created the page we created this kind of an object structure.
1

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,700
The important thing here is we don't really have any class to represent the todo structure.
2

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,360
The best practice is to create two classes to represent the structure, and do that to create the todo.
3

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,500
Let's start doing that in this specific step.
4

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,940
Let's create a class called Todo, as you discussed earlier Javascript module file.
5

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:40,180
So this file... each file... each typescript file is javascript module, and in this file, you can have any
6

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,050
number of classes created.
7

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,020
So let's create one more class export class.
8

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,220
Let's call this Todo.
9

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,480
And in this class I would want to create a.
10

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,930
So you could have a constructor created with a few parameters, allright. With these parameters must be
11

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,730
public. Let's start with creating the ID, so id:number it has public description, description is the string
12

13
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,750
next for each todo,  you would want to maintain when it's completed or not.
13

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,990
You call this done, and the type of this is boolean.
14

15
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,210
And the last one which I would want to happen.
15

16
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,040
Each todo has a target date.
16

17
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,850
When do you want a completed by the date, and the target date will have it as a date.
17

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,090
Now the constructor is already one of the important typescript.
18

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,270
Each of these constructor arguments becomes a member when you create the object of this piece.
19

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,540
So let's see what would happen here.
20

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:56,830
I can do now instead of this new todo of 1, the next one is the description so I can copy into
21

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,430
learn to dance
22

23
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,840
have the id, we have the description and the next one is is it done or not.
23

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,350
No it's not done yet.
24

25
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,950
I would still need to do it.
25

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,560
And new Date... I created a new date and I copy this again.
26

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:22,150
Now let's say the next todo is 2, and let's say the next one is to 'become an expert at English'.
27

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm not sure if it's true or false.
28

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,860
Let's leave it at false.
29

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,140
And the last one is 3, 'visit your favorite country'.
30

31
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,570
You can decide whether you have completed the visit or not.
31

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,870
I'll comment this out, and learn what is coming down here.
32

33
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,610
What we are doing is moving away from an unstructured format to being structure.
33

34
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,610
We are creating a class to represent that todo.
34

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,280
And let's update the todos competent so that we have to do. What I need to that description that
35

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,420
does not really need to change.
36

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
Let's see what would happen.
37

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,740
You'd see that when you press refresh, things are still working what I would want to do is I would
38

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,460
want to update the field to which we are showing right now.
39

40
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:13,110
I don't think anybody would care about the ID, so let's throw the id out, and what we add in is description.
40

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,760
And let's make it a capital D,  the let's add target date
41

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,620
and let's add in another one
42

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:37,200
is Completed, and let's add them in to the description todo.targetDate.
43

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,540
todo.
44

45
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,590
let's see what happens.
45

46
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,730
You can see now my todos: description, target date and is completed.
46

47
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,990
And now you can see that this is not really well formatted especially the target date.
47

48
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,960
Target date.
48

49
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,720
We will want to format it for that.
49

50
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,180
So we use something called a pipe.
50

51
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,600
So what we have is a field.
51

52
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,870
So this field value you would want to format it as a normal date.
52

53
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,410
What would happen now? let's do a refresh, and you can see that this is the default format of date.
53

54
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,280
There are a number of things that you can use pipe for. pipe is basically a way you convert one value
54

55
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,860
into another format.
55

56
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,900
Here we are saying we want to convert it into a normal date format. If you would want to have everything
56

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,340
in uppercase, you can say uppercase again. You would see that everything.
57

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,650
So nov eight now appears in, NOV is in caps. Or if you'd want everything it would be in lowercase
58

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,530
you can do lowercase.
59

60
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,640
So these are all called pipes, and pipes are used to convert one field in one format to another format
60

61
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,340
and you'd want to do to lowercase with the field, you would use a pipe so you can see that everything
61

62
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,070
is in lowercase.
62

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,460
Don't worry about the lowercase, I'll remove it.
63

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,150
What we have now is a relatively well designed todo page In this step, we created the class constructor
64

65
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,490
and.
65

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,250
We created a number of todos, and we used the component to display them.
66

67
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:16,110
We used a couple of pipes to convert the target date into a more visually appealing format.
67

68
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm sure you are having a lot of fun.
68

69
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,110
We are taking a lot of rapid strides in the last few steps, and I'll see you in the next step.
69

70
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,420
Until then, bye bye.
