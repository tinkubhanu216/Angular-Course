00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,330
This is how the page looks like right now. In this step, let's format a few of the elements on the screen, so
2

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,770
that they look much better.
3

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,650
Let's start with the top menu.
4

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm going to visual studio code.
5

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,090
This is where our menu component is coded in. Let's make a list of things that we would want to do.
6

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:29,950
By HTML5 standards,  the menu should be in something called a header, and inside a class, inside a element
7

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,260
called head.
8

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,450
All our elements should come inside nav.
9

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,630
So let's move this stuff out, and let's try and put a list of elements that I would want to have in here.
10

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,710
So first create a div and inside this div, I would put the name of the application or the
11

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,470
brand or something like that, and let's create a link for that.
12

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:01,920
So href= this, and instead put in this. Let's just say this is like the UI of the website.
13

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,500
https://www.in28minutes.com.
14

15
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,620
Maximize the page and over here, we would want to show a list of menu items.
15

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,270
What we want to show is, we want to list items here and to list items.
16

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,400
At the end. We'll show home, and let's say todos here, and log in and log out at the corner.
17

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:32,980
So I create an ordered list. Actually should have started with that list and inside that would be... yes
18

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,100
each of those lists would contain links.
19

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,760
So let's create that a href= "" 
20

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,150
where it needs to link, to the link.
21

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,920
There are a few bootstrap classes that we need to add.
22

23
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:59,770
So I'll add them in. Wehn something represents the navigation bar in Bootstrap, the class do you need to add
23

24
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,740
is navbar.
24

25
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,210
And I would want to expand all the list elements which represents what I would need to show. I will expand
25

26
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,560
this part of navigation of the navbar, so I need to say 
26

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,950
navbar-nav
27

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
And this is one of the links which is present.
28

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,260
So they should be navbar-link.
29

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,130
So what we are doing is just having a few standard bootstrap classes. I would recommend you to look up
30

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,360
the bootstrap documentation if you want to understand this further.
31

32
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,120
I am no means an expert at bootstrap, but I really like the application to look a little better than
32

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,940
what we have right now.
33

34
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,130
So let's quickly add a few things.
34

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,960
So if you save and refresh the page you'd see something at the top.
35

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,380
And I think that's how it's reflecting  as of now enough to create a couple of links Let's call this home.
36

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
And this would be to do with it. See what would happen.
37

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,060
So you can see in28minutes,  home, todos at the top that's cool. And what we'll do is we'll
38

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:15,790
have another set of links going up, so you'll see all this stuff at the top.
39

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,460
You just need to add a few more classes to make them appear beautiful.
40

41
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,830
Before that let's add the home link. What's the link to the home page?
41

42
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,150
/welcome.
42

43
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,750
Fair enough.
43

44
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,270
hard-code this value, right?
44

45
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:40,650
So /welcome/in28minutes, /todos,  would be the link for todos,and /login would be the link 
45

46
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,510
for login.
46

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,790
We did not create the log out page yet.
47

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,210
We'll create it a little later, we'll put /logout.
48

49
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,120
One of the things I have done wrong, is actually this class should be nav-link.,not
49

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,020
navbar-link.
50

51
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,980
Let's fix that.
51

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,110
And let's see how it looks on the page.
52

53
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,240
So you have in28minutes,  home, todos, login, logout
53

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,050
That's cool.
54

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,390
This link is the link of the brand.
55

56
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,100
So let's add a class called navbar-brand. and move in28minutes to the next line. Cool. in28minutes
56

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,160
is now little more highlighted.
57

58
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:25,160
We would want this log in and log out to appear at the end of the page, or at the right hand corner of
58

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,220
the page.
59

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:36,470
So what we need to do is add something like navbar-collapse, and another class justify-content-end.
60

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,630
and now you have in28minutes, the two links here, login and logout in the corner.
61

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:52,330
Now I would want to give a dark background to this screen, so I'll say it navbar-dark, and I would
62

63
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,600
want to change the background to dark.
63

64
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,410
So you'd see that the background is cool!
64

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,510
You have all the links present.
65

66
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,430
So we have our menu very well designed.
66

67
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,000
What we were looking at in this specific step, is how we have to design a menu.
67

68
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,510
If you are good at this then it should have been easy for you.
68

69
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,660
But if you did not know bootstrap before, then some of these classes might be new.
69

70
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,320
You can look up bootstrap documentation for information about these classes.
70

71
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,010
But the purpose of all this thing was to get a good looking header, and that's what we were able to do,
71

72
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,300
in this specific step.
72

73
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,630
We will look at more stuff in the next step. Until then, bye!
