Welcome back. In the previous two steps, the focus was on getting things working.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,150
We were able to quickly get started with creating a simple login page, a welcome page, and mytodos

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,030
page.

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,860
The focus of the next few steps is on building up on what we already have, and giving it a nice look

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,870
and feel.

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,580
Have a nice navigation menu and footer.

00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,000
Use bootstrap to style everything out.

00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,680
Have proper security systems so that not everybody would be able to get into todos without logging

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,270
in, and to refactor some of the stuff that we did to separate some of these components.

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm sure this would be an interesting refactoring journey and I'll see you in the next step. Bye bye!
