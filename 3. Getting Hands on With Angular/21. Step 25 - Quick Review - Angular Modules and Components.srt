Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,190
Before we go any further, let's review all the concepts that we have learned during the last few steps.
2

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,420
Angular applications are built using a number of angular modules.
3

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,990
There would be a custom built angular modules, which I built as part of your application as well as in
4

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,720
built Angular modules. Which you make use of. If you want to reuse a component, you would need to import
5

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,200
these specific Angular Modules
6

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,100
Whenever you create Angular components, 
7

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,670
You need to associate it with an angular module.
8

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,030
So the application is built up of Angular modules, which in turn is nothing but a set of angular component
9

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,500
or directives or building blocks of angular.
10

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,300
Each component has a template which is basically a HTML file where typical HTML
11

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,030
is combined with a few angular specific things, like angular binding syntax right.
12

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,200
We looked at interpolation.
13

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,650
Look at 2-way binding. We looked at event binding as well.
14

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,770
The style CSS part of it, because it is basically the place where we put all the data in as well
15

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,000
as how should we react to the view actions.
16

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,220
So we'll put methods which help us react to view actions the different data binding features in Angular
17

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,940
help us to bind the template to the code. To be able to bind the view, the HTML, to specific data and specific
18

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,810
event which are described in the code.
19

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,470
We also looked at routing, which helps us mainly get from one component to another.
20

21
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,400
We also made use of a number of ng directives, angular directivess and the forms. We made use of ngIf,
21

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,510
ngFor. We made use of the pipes. While we learn a lot of things in the last few steps, there are a lot.
22

23
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,110
of things remaining as well.
23

24
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,470
Other things is look at the design of the pages.
24

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,860
Right now they don't really look appealing.
25

26
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,230
We would want to use something like bootstrap, we would want to create a few proper menus.
26

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,110
You don't have a proper footer.
27

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,970
The other important thing is there is no security for the menus at all.
28

29
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,470
If I did localhost:4200/todo, you'd be able to look at the list of those you don't really have
29

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,710
to log in to be able to see the todos.
30

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,190
I don't need to really do this, and go and click this to go to those even without logging in.
31

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,460
If I go to a new page, and type in todos, I will be able to still see the todos. it's highly secure.
32

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,660
The other thing is hardcoded. Logic of the ToDo list is hardcoded.
33

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,160
It's not really coming from the rest API or something of that kind.
34

35
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,630
The same is the case with authentication.
35

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,000
We have a hard coded logic which is present in there, and there is a lot of Todo functionality which
36

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
is remaining to create it.
37

38
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:53,670
We need to be able to edit, view and delete Todo's and add todo's, and we have not even started creating
38

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,350
the basics of a piece, with springboot and spring security.
39

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,260
There are a lot of work ahead of us and in the future steps.
40

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,520
Let's focus on getting things done one by one.
41

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,070
I'm really excited to go on this journey of building a full stack application with you and I'll see
42

43
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,300
you in the next step.
