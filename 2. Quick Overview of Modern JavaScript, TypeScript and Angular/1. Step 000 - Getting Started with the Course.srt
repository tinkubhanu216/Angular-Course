00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,290
Welcome back! In the step, you'll want to help you get quickly started this course.
1

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,740
The first thing I would want to do, is to congratulate you on making a great decision in choosing this
2

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,590
course.
3

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,040
Now, let's get down to getting started with the course.
4

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,150
The first thing you would need to do, is to bookmark the GitHub repository of this course.
5

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,310
You'll find a link to it in the resources section of the video you are watching.
6

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,100
You just have to hover over to the left top corner of your screen, and you should see resources, and a
7

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,780
link to the repository.
8

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:43,320
Just click it, and launch the GitHub repository, and bookmark the URL. The repository contains links
9

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,370
to all the installation we use, 
10

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,610
Step-by-step details of the code and the source code.
11

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,580
Also present is backup of all the code at various points.
12

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,900
For example, this is the last backup.
13

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,710
This is the final backup of the code in this specific course. yYou'd see that the backup is present as
14

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,660
a single file, so that if you face a problem you can use this as a reference.
15

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,070
You can look at how it is done here, and check how you are approaching it.
16

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,840
The first two sections of this course would extensively focus on Angular. The tools you would need for
17

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,310
that section is NPM, and Visual Studio Code.
18

19
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,640
We can install Java and Eclipse a little later.
19

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,190
For now you can launch this playlist which would help us to install NodeJS, which is NPM, and Visual Studio
20

21
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,760
Code.
21

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,690
This list contains three steps: Installing nodejs, and npm,  a quick introduction to NPM, and installing
22

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,090
Visual Studio Code.
23

24
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,300
I would recommend to pause the video in here, and continue with the installation of nodejs and Visual
24

25
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,220
Studio Code.
25

26
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,420
If you have successfully installed nodejs and Visual Studio Code,  you are now all set to rock the
26

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,610
Angular world.
27

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,110
If you are a Java developer, the first few steps can be overwhelming.
28

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,540
You will be using a new language. More than javascript and typescript, you will be using a new IDE,  Visual
29

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,820
Studio Code. You'll be using a new framework: Angular, with a new tool: Angular CLI,  which is used to create
30

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,560
angular projects.
31

32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,630
The first seven steps contain a little bit of theory, to introduce you to the various part of developing
32

33
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,880
modern javascript applications.
33

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,980
Once you get to the second section of the course, you'll be spending 95 percent of the time getting your
34

35
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,570
hands dirty.
35

36
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,930
The recommended approach to follow in the course, is to take steps one at a time.
36

37
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,180
Do them in the order which is present in here.
37

38
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,710
If you are in a hurry to get your hands dirty and write a lot of code, then you can skip step 6 and
38

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,620
Step 7, and come back to them a little later. We'll talk about all the remaining sections of this course
39

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,380
when we get to them.
40

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,420
Let's get started with understanding the application.
41

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,870
architecture, in the next step.
