1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,530
In the previous step, we have installed Angular CLI.
1

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,980
Let's create our first Angular application using Angular CLI, in this specific step.
2

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,530
Before we get started with creating an Angular App,  let's learn a little bit more about ng,  the Angular
3

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,260
CLI.
4

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,670
So ng help is what you need to type to get help on the Angular client.
5

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,690
You can see all the different commands which are present in here.
6

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,290
We've were already used ng version.
7

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,820
ng version gives you what version of AngularCLI do you have
8

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,670
So ng space version would give you the version of the Angular CLI which is installed.
9

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,810
Let's go ahead and try and help again.
10

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,090
You can see that there are a wide variety of commands available.
11

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,780
ng new which is present over here is used to create an angular App.
12

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,200
So when you want to create a new Angular project, you can say ng new.
13

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,740
The other useful command is ng generate. When we talk about angular applications,
14

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,550
They are built using modules, components,  reuse the initial code for those modules and components can
15

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,840
be generated by using the command
16

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,820
ng generate. The other commands which are available are: to build your code,  to run the code quality checks which
17

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:29,650
is called in,  to run the application, to run your unit tests, as well as your end-to-end tests.
18

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:36,240
One of my favorite commands which is present in here is called ng serve. If I use the command and
19

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,930
ng serve... then I suppose I make a code change.
20

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,050
The change would be automatically picked up by the application.
21

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,810
OK.
22

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,410
Enough Theory Now.
23

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,150
Let's get to the practical stuff. Before we start creating an Angular app,
24

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,250
You need to make a first decision, right, where you want to create it.
25

26
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,710
So you need the cd down to the folder where you would want to create the specific project .I'd want to
26

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,130
create the project in the directory that I'm showing on the screen right now.
27

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,500
The most important thing is, just have a sub-folder called  front-end, so that all the front-end code goes in there.
28

29
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,590
So I'm cd-ing to that folder.
29

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,010
And here is where you would want to create our Angular project.
30

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:22,090
The way would create an Angular project is by ng new, and the name of the project.
31

32
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,440
So use the command ng new <the name of the project> that we would want to create. If you press
32

33
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,490
enter right now.
33

34
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,400
And It would ask you a few questions.
34

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,400
The first thing is would you like to have angular routing?
35

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,890
Yes. I would have multiple screens, and I would want to have a screen fill between them.
36

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,490
So I would add Angular routing.
37

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,550
We'll talk about Angular routing in detail, a little later.
38

39
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,110
I'll say yes.
39

40
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,380
The question it's asking me is, which style sheet format would you like to use.
40

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
The default is the SASS.
41

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,090
You can use arrow buttons to scroll down and scroll up.
42

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,810
I would want to stick with the SASS, to keep things simple.
43

44
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,160
You can see that it started creating your angular application.
44

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,410
There might be a few warnings.
45

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,390
You can ignore them.
46

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,220
The project is generated and it's actually now trying to build the project.
47

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,930
If this is the first time you're building an Angular project on your machine, it might take a long while,
48

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,950
a few minutes in certain circumstances.
49

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,490
You can see that the installation is going on.
50

51
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,620
And finally you'll see the success message!
51

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,150
Now, if I want to list the contents of the directories either ls, or the dir, you would see that there's
52

53
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,100
a folder called "todo" which is created in here.
53

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,230
Let cd into todo/,  and type in ls or dir.
54

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,900
So if you're on Windows the command is dir, instead ls.
55

56
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,640
What you would see, is a project is created inside the folder todo.
56

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,280
And there are a wide variety of files which are present in here.
57

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,940
Make sure that you are inside the todo folder, and now you can start executing the command to build
58

59
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,860
and run the application. So we would be using the command  ng <space> serve.
59

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:16,000
So type in ng <space> serve, and press <enter>, and you can see that it's listening on local host at 4200,
60

61
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,210
And it's actually building the modules right now.
61

62
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,710
So we need to wait until this is hundred percent... okay! Now it's 100%,  and it doesn't and it just compile successfully
62

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,190
and it's opening up in the browser at this specific location so the recommended browser that we would
63

64
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,220
be using through this course is Google Chrome.
64

65
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,280
So make sure that you're using Chrome as well. In Chrome.
65

66
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,900
Go out and type in localhost:4200, and just press <enter>.
66

67
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,090
COOL!! You see page come up... it says Welcome to todo!
67

68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,660
And you would see a few links to the angler blog: tutorials and CLI documentation.
68

69
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,940
If you had an error when you were running this command.
69

70
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,590
Make sure that you did a CD into the todo folder.
70

71
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,260
So make sure that you are inside the todo folder before running the command ng.
71

72
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,170
So that's a common mistake a lot of new comers do in this step.
72

73
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,240
We were able to quickly generate it on the app and we were able to run it.
73

74
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,020
Our real journey starts from the next step.
74

75
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,120
We would start understanding what's happening in the background as well, as you would start creating our
75

76
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,990
own Angular app.
76

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,210
I'm excited to bring all this to you ,and I'll see you in the next video.
