00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,860
Welcome back. In this step, let's focus on installing Angular CLI.
1

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,140
If you google for Angular CLI, the first result would be cli.angular.io.
2

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,950
Once you get to that web page, you would see that Angular CLI is a command line interface for Agular.
3

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,310
If there was ever an understatement, then this is the one!
4

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,510
Angular CLI
5

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,570
not only helps you create new Angular applications, but also it helps you to generate a lot of code while
6

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,180
we are developing the angular application.
7

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,590
It helps us to run our application locally, and also run our unit tests.
8

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,450
integration tests, run our code quality checks and things like that.
9

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,750
Installing Angular CLI is very very easy.
10

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,010
The first step is to launch up your terminal or command prompt.
11

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,830
So I'm on Mac.
12

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,530
I'm launching up my terminal and you can see that the terminal has launched up.
13

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,340
If you're on Windows make sure that you are launching up your command prompt.
14

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,660
All that you need to do is to click the Start button.
15

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,200
Typing cmd, the CMT command prompt would come up and make sure that you are bringing it up as an administrator.
16

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,660
So I click on it and make sure that you are running it as an administrator.
17

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,430
You would have your terminal command prompt launched up.
18

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,030
So let's go ahead and check our Node version which is installed. The way
19

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:29,060
you can check your node version is node -v.  And we make sure that you at least have v 8. If you want
20

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,200
you can go and check the npm version as well. So the npm version that we have here is 6.4, and any version which
21

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,130
is better than 6 should be fine. If you don't have these options right.
22

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,810
then I would recommend to go and check the installation video for node version again, and make sure that
23

24
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,060
you have the right version right now.
24

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,710
We are all set to start installing angular CLI,  and Angular CLI is present as an npm module.
25

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:00,810
So all that you need to do, is do npm install -g @angular/cli 
26

27
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,040
I would want to get the latest version of Angular that 7.
27

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,670
So I'll add at 7..
28

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,110
So the command is very simple.
29

30
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,220
npm install -g @angular@cli@7.0.3
30

31
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,490
If you have problems typing in you can also copy it from here, and append at 7.0.3 and I would press enter.
31

32
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,450
Now what would happen is to download the Angular CLI,
32

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,410
One of the important things if you're a Java developer, you can kind of think of NPM as Maven. Like
33

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
Maven download the dependencies the plugins for you.
34

35
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:46,540
So Angular CLIis almost like a maven plugin, and we are using NPM to download it for us.
35

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,580
This download might take a little while.
36

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,480
If you are on a slow network or if you are doing this for the first time and the install.
37

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,980
I got an error.
38

39
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,160
It is missing right.
39

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,410
Access to.
40

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,460
So if you got this error if you got the same error that I got then it means you don't have admin permissions
41

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,160
so if you're on Windows you can have admin permissions when you run a command prompt, is by making sure
42

43
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,470
that when you're launching up the command prompt, you are launching it as: click and on as-administrator
43

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,340
so this will ensure that you have admin rights when you are launching at the command prompt. On Mac or
44

45
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:28,100
on Linux,  you can assign admin permissions is by using sudo.
45

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,300
So I just need to type in sudo before the command.
46

47
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,250
I'm saying sudo space and npm space install and the exec and as it goes.
47

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,080
So no it would ask me for the administrator password to go out and interview a password.
48

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,890
If you have any I wanted my password and now you see that it would start doing the same process again.
49

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,600
So this is very important when we installed node module.
50

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:03,390
Make sure that you have admin rights. Now you can see that there is a local module installed, so it saves
51

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,190
+ Angular/cli@7.0.3
52

53
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,370
Because I did this on my machine earlier, it happened very fast down here.
53

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
It may be a couple of minutes on a slow network.
54

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,980
When the installation of Angular CLI is complete, we can go out and test it.
55

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,890
The way you can check the version of the Angular CLI is by saying ng version.
56

57
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,520
ng version this should give you the version of Angular CLI that is installed.
57

58
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:39,050
So here I can see that I'm using Angular CLI version 7.0.3 .
58

59
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,480
You can also see that Node version,  and also you can see the versions of a few other packages which Angular
59

60
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,800
CLI makes use of. The most important thing for us is that any version which is greater than 7
60

61
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,550
is good enough.  In this Quick step, we installed Angular CLI which should be used to generate our first angular
61

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,690
application.
62

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,270
I'll see you in the next step.
63

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,270
Until then, bye-bye!
